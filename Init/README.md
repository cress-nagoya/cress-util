Templates to make initial and boundary conditions for various model simulations

## Ideal_TC
To make initial and boundary conditions for numerical experiments of idealized tropical cyclones. 

The templates are used in an external program `TC_Bogus` [(Zenodo Link)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4558393) developed by Satoki Tsujino.
